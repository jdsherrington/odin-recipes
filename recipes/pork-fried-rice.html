    <h1>Pork Fried Rice</h1>
    <img src="./images/pork-fried-rice.jpeg">
    <p>This is my revised version of another pork fried rice recipe. I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesn't change anything. I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference. I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes. Enjoy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) boneless pork loin chop, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped carrot</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped broccoli</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup cold cooked rice</li>
        <li>¼ cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir pork, carrot, broccoli, peas, and green onion in melted butter until pork is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove pork mixture to a bowl and return skillet to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Scramble egg in the skillet until completely set. Return the pork mixture to the skillet. Stir rice, peas, soy sauce, garlic powder, and ground ginger into the pork mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
